# controlwithhand
this repo is about controling some stuff in your pc with your hand by using hand tracking and gesture recognition technologies

Thanks to AI, computer vision and tracking algorithms, our world is transferring to something similar to sciencfiction movies.
In this project I want to discover more about these technologies by doing some projects. I am thinking to use some gesture recognition or hand tracking utilities to do some stuff in my pc without using keyboard or mouse.(Cool).
